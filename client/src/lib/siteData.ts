    intro: "A DUI charge in Arizona carries severe consequences that can impact your driving privileges, your career, and your freedom. Arizona has some of the toughest DUI laws in the nation, with mandatory minimum sentences that judges must impose. Whether you are facing a first-offense DUI or an aggravated felony DUI, having an experienced criminal defense attorney can make the difference between a conviction and a favorable outcome. Jess A. Lorona has defended hundreds of DUI cases and understands the science, the law, and the procedures that prosecutors must follow. From challenging field sobriety tests to questioning breathalyzer calibration records, every detail matters in a DUI defense.",

      { q: "What is the legal BAC limit in Arizona?", a: "The legal limit is 0.08 for most drivers. For commercial drivers, it is 0.04. For drivers under 21, Arizona has a zero-tolerance policy, meaning any detectable alcohol can result in charges." },
      { q: "Will I lose my license after a DUI arrest?", a: "Your license may be suspended, but you have only 15 days from the date of arrest to request an MVD hearing. We can help you request this hearing and potentially prevent or reduce the suspension." },
      { q: "What is the difference between extreme DUI and aggravated DUI?", a: "Extreme DUI involves a BAC of 0.15 or higher. Aggravated DUI is a felony charge that applies when you have a prior DUI, were driving with a suspended license, or had a child under 15 in the vehicle." },
      { q: "Can a DUI charge be reduced or dismissed?", a: "Yes. Depending on the circumstances, we may challenge the traffic stop, field sobriety tests, breathalyzer results, or blood test procedures. If law enforcement made errors, evidence may be suppressed." },

      { q: "Can drug charges be expunged in Arizona?", a: "Arizona does not have traditional expungement, but you may be eligible for a set-aside judgment, which can help with employment and housing. We can evaluate your eligibility during a consultation." },
      { q: "What is the difference between possession and possession for sale?", a: "Possession for sale is a much more serious charge. Prosecutors look at factors like quantity, packaging, scales, cash, and communications to prove intent to sell. We challenge these factors aggressively." },
